# Better Spotify Search

Sort your Spotify Searches

</div>

---

## Why 🤔

The inbuilt Spotify search functionality does not allow to sort by likes/followers. The default sorting does not make
sense (maybe a combination of hotness, recommendation, and popularity) which I dislike.

## How 🧐

Just used [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/)'s API.

## Usage 👨‍💻

Go through Spotipy's [docs](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy#installation) for installation and getting API keys.
That's it!

```shell
python sort_spotify_search.py -q SEARCH_QUERY [-n NUMBER_OF_RESULTS]
```
